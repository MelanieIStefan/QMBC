%% Solutions to Timelapse Microscopy Exercise
% Created 6/1/2012 by JW
% 
% *SPOILER ALERT* This file provides solutions to the exercises from the
% MATLAB intro packet. The best way to remember what you learned is to
% spend time thinking about and doing the exercises on your own. Refer to
% this only after you've tried the exercisesREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHfirst without, and then with
% the hintsREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHand gotten stuck!
% 
% HOW TO USE THIS FILE: This solution file doubles as a step-by-step
% tutorial reference. Each separate task in the problem is in its own cell
% (delimited by a %% at the beginning of the line). You should start by
% reading the comments and looking at the code without running it. Try to
% predict what each line of code does. Then, to see the code in action,
% press CTRL-ENTER to run your current cell. The cells should be run in
% order so that necessary variables are declared at the right times.

%% 0. Clear your workspace
% Start with an empty workspace to avoid unexpected variable name conflicts

clc     % clear command window
clear   % clear workspace
close all   % clear all figures

%% 1a. Load the file overlay_sequence.mat into MATLAB. 
% Load a pre-processed stack of images. This loads a variable named 'imseq'
% into our workspace. The .mat file format is specific to MATLAB. MATLAB
% variables can be conveniently stored to files via the 'save' command, and
% loaded later using 'load'. Type 'doc save' and 'doc load' to learn more.
load('overlay_sequence.mat');

% Explore what data type and dimensions 'imseq' is
whos imseq

% You should see that this is a 4-D array containing data of type 'uint8'.
% This is a typical data format for image files. Why are there 4
% dimensions? Maybe knowing the size of each dimension will help:
size(imseq)

%% 1b.	Play the image sequence as a movie. 
implay(imseq)

%% 1c.	Can you tell by eye which strain is growing faster? 
% This plays the movie slower, at 8 frames per second.
implay(imseq,8)

% You might be able to convince yourself that the green cells are growing
% faster near the end of the movie, but it's hard to say without
% quantitation.

%% 2a. Plan image analysis strategy.
% The basic approach for this problem will be identical to the technique
% you used in Yeast Showdown I to identify RFP and YFP cells. We choose a
% threshold intensity value and consider every pixel whose intensity is
% greater than the threshold to be part of a cell, and all other pixels as
% background. This is called thresholding.

%% 2b.	Test out some segmentation code on a single frame. 

% Load a single image file to play with.
img = imread('images/YFP/YFP_frame_1.TIF');

% Uncomment the below to segment the last frame instead
% img = imread('images/YFP/YFP_frame_97.TIF');

% Or segment an mCherry frame instead
% img = imread('images/mCherry/mCherry_frame_10.TIF');

% Calculate a threshold for this image using 'graythresh'. This is a
% built-in function that determines the optimal threshold for
% distinguishing between cells and background.
thresh = graythresh(img)

% Threshold the image. 
img_thresh = im2bw(img,thresh);
% Using im2bw is equivalent to 
%   im_thresh = double(im)>thresh
% 
% MATLAB built-in commands are good to use, even when you're trying to do
% something simple, because they often include additional optimizations and
% error-checking.

% Display the results
figure, imshow(img,[])  % raw image
figure, imshow(img_thresh)   % thresholded image
% How do the results look? You can see that some areas between cells are
% being counted as part of cells. This is "undersegmentation." If you
% increase the threshold, you will be able to eliminate some
% undersegmentation, but run the risk of "oversegmentation," where a single
% cell gets counted as multiple cells. This is an inherent limitation of
% our thresholding-only approach. You can use more advanced operations to
% get around this problem, but the purposes of this exercise we will assume
% that thresholding is good enough.

% Pixel area of cells
area = sum(img_thresh(:))

%% 2c.	Put your code for segmenting a single frame into a function. 
% This code does the same area calculation as the previous cell.
img = imread('images/YFP/YFP_frame_1.TIF');
[area, thresh_img] = segment_frame(img,graythresh(img));

% What are the inputs and outputs of the 'segment_frame' function? To see
% the code, type
edit segment_frame

% What do these show when uncommented?
% figure,imshow(img);
% figure,imshow(thresh_img);

% What happens if you run the function like this?
% area = segment_frame(img,graythresh(img));

% Or like this?
% [~, thresh_img] = segment_frame(img,graythresh(img));

% This function is pretty short. Why did we even bother writing it? What's
% the advantage of putting this code in a function?

%% 2d.	Apply your segmentation to all frames. (This code takes awhile)
% In other words, loop through all 97 frames in both YFP and mCherry
% channels, load the corresponding image file, and call your function from
% part c.
% 
% If you calculated the threshold individually for each frame, you may have
% gotten strange-looking plots from the results. This is because the
% graythresh algorithm seems to be sensitive to variation in illumination
% between frames (in particular, what does graythresh give for mCherry
% frame 3? Try running cell 2c. again to see). Using a single threshold (in
% this case, based on the last frame) means that you are using the same
% definition of cell and background in each frame.

numchannels = 2;    % Number the channels: 1 is YFP, 2 is mCherry
numframes = 97;

YFP_filename_root = 'images/YFP/YFP_frame_';
mCherry_filename_root = 'images/mCherry/mCherry_frame_';

% Use a fixed threshold computed from the last frame
YFPimg = imread([YFP_filename_root num2str(97) '.TIF']);
mCherryimg = imread([mCherry_filename_root num2str(97) '.TIF']);
thresh(1) = graythresh(YFPimg);
thresh(2) = graythresh(mCherryimg);

% segmentation results
areas = []; % why clear this variable before the loop?

% Loop through channels, frames
for channel = 1:numchannels 
    for frame = 1:numframes
        if channel == 1
            frame_filename = [YFP_filename_root num2str(frame) '.TIF'];
            % what does frame_filename contain on each run of the loop?
        elseif channel == 2
            frame_filename = [mCherry_filename_root num2str(frame) '.TIF'];
        end

        % load image
        img = imread(frame_filename);
        
        % segment and save result
        areas(channel,frame) = segment_frame(img,thresh(channel));
    end

% What does the variable 'areas' contain at the end of this cell?

%% 3a.	Plot the pixel area of cells versus time (or frame number). 
figure
plot(0:10:960,areas','.');
% What happens if you type areas instead of areas' ?

% plot vertical line at the moment of galactose induction (frame 31)
hold all
plot([300 300],ylim);
% Why does this plot a vertical line? Figure out what ylim does: type
% 'ylim' on the command line and compare the values it outputs with
% the y axis on your plot.

xlabel('Time (min)');
ylabel('pixel area');
title('Area of cells versus time');

legend('YFP (wt)','mCherry (\DeltaGAL2)');

% Now log-transform the data. Which axis scaling is better? 
figure
plot(0:10:960,log2(areas'),'.');

hold all
plot([300 300],ylim);

xlabel('Time (min)');
ylabel('log_2 pixel area');
title('Log_2 area of cells versus time');
legend('YFP (wt)','mCherry (\DeltaGAL2)');

%% 3b.	Do some sanity checks on your data. 
% Do the plots look how you expected them to? Are the cells
% growing exponentially? What are possible caveats or
% limitations of this data? For example, before the media switch, we don’t
% expect a difference in growth because ?GAL2 shouldn’t affect metabolism
% of raffinose. Are your plots consistent with this expectation? If not,
% what might be the reason?
% 
% The cells are growing exponentially, since the plot of the log of their
% pixel areas versus time makes a straight line. The wt and mutant lines
% seem to have the same slope before galactose induction, consistent with
% our expectation that the mutation doesn't growth under non-galactose
% carbon sources. 

%% 3c.	Consider the effects of galactose induction. 
% Does it look like there a cost to GAL pathway induction? Is there a
% difference between the growth of cells in raffinose versus in raffinose
% and galactose? How long does it take before there is a difference in
% growth between the wildtype and gal2 mutant cells? Is there a cost to
% galactose induction (i.e. does growth slow immediately after adding
% galactose)?

% To compare the two strains, you may want to normalize pixel areas to the
% time of media switch.
areas(1,:) = areas(1,:)./areas(1,31);
areas(2,:) = areas(2,:)./areas(2,31);

figure
plot(0:10:960,log2(areas'),'.');

hold all
plot([300 300],ylim);

xlabel('Time (min)');
ylabel('log_2 pixel area');
title('Log_2 area of cells versus time, normalized to induction timepoint');
legend('YFP (wt)','mCherry (\DeltaGAL2)');

% It looks like the wt strain starts growing faster ~3 hours after
% galactose induction, whereas the gal2 mutant continues growing at the
% same rate as if nothing happened. There may be a slight cost to
% GAL induction, since the line for the wildtype strain goes slightly below
% that of the mutant strain immediately after galactose addition, but it's
% unclear based on this data whether the difference is significant.

%% 4d.	Consider more data.
% Load the file allfields.mat. What variables were loaded and what do their
% dimensions mean?
load allfields
whos YFP_allfields
whos mCherry_allfields
% These variables contain pixel areas. YFP_allfields contains data from the
% YFP channel, and similarly for mCherry_allfields. Each row is a
% microscope field (20 total), and each column is a frame (97 total).

% Combine the data from all the fields and plot the results. Since each
% field was taken under identical conditions, we can treat the 20 fields as
% one giant field and sum the data.
YFP_combined = sum(YFP_allfields);
mCherry_combined = sum(mCherry_allfields);

% Normalize to induction timepoint
YFP_combined(1,:) = YFP_combined./YFP_combined(31);
mCherry_combined(1,:) = mCherry_combined./mCherry_combined(31);

t = 0:10:960;
figure,plot(t, log2(YFP_combined),'.');
hold all;
plot(t, log2(mCherry_combined),'.');

% Induction timepoint
plot([300 300],ylim);

xlabel('Time (min)');
ylabel('log_2 pixel area');
title('Log_2 normalized area of cells versus time, sum over 20 fields');
legend('YFP (wt)','mCherry (\DeltaGAL2)');

% These results look similar to our analysis from a single
% microscope field above. It still looks as though there's no decrease in
% growth rate of the wt strain after GAL induction, although in the combined
% data, the growth rate of the wt increases a little sooner after induction
% than was apparent from the single-field plot (the blue line diverges from
% the green line at ~450 min rather than >500 min.
